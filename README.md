# Intro_to_DL_course
Parts of the "An introduction to deep learning" course, taught by Moeen Tayebi will be gradually stored here.
This course was aimed at high school students with some elementary experience in programming, including knowledge on "for" loops and lists (no matter in what langauge).
The "Numpy_Tutorial" has been originally part of the "An introduction to deep learning" but can also be used on its own to learn or teach the basics of numpy and matrix manipulation in general.
